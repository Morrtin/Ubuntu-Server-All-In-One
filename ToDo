Server
========================
- Solve transfer speed Problem: Copy from Server to Client over Samba Share takes ages
- Next big step: Groupware - Zarafa

XBMC
========================
- Add support to exit xbmc to terminal
- Drop into console login when Exit in Powermenu in XBMC.
- Correct INTEL CPU temperature via advancedsettings.xml to show real temerature.
